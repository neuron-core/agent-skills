# Orders CSV validation

Read references/order-format.md for the import requirements.

Run `php scripts/validate.php <csv-file>` on the file supplied by the user.
The validator reads its rules from config/validation.json and reports
errors by row and column.

Summarize whether the file is ready to import. For rejected rows, explain
what needs to be corrected. A validation failure is a finding to report,
not evidence that the check could not run.
